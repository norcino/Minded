# Builder

## Introduction
Builder is a class library that helps create new objects with random data and hierarchy.

Its main usage is in testing where the often the data creation takes too much attention to the reader other than the actual test purpose.
It is possible to customise the data generation only for the specific fileds and proporties which are meant to be tested.
